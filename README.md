# Features

- Adds `Close All Tabs` for the current group.
- Adds `Sticky Tabs` that allows a user select certain tabs that will not close when a tab close command is issued.
- Adds variants of the close commands to skip unsaved files, or to dismiss saved files with no prompt.
- Overrides the built-in tab commands and 'close' and 'close_all' commands to work with sticky tabs.
- Keep active window focus on delete, or default to the last active, left, or right tab (user configurable).
- Add open last tab, reveal in sidebar or finder, copy file path, save options, and revert.
- Adds tab sorting options (based loosely on @bizoo's [SortTabs](https://github.com/bizoo/SortTabs) plugin).
- Access clone, delete, rename, move, save, reveal, copy file path, revert, etc.
